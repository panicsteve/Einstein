ROM Dumper Read Me

Introduction
------------
ROM Dumper is a very simple utility to dump the Newton's ROM via TCP/IP.
I wrote it to provide an alternative way to dump the ROM and use it with
Einstein emulator (the original method implied using a low-level debugger
and worked over a serial link).

Principle
---------
ROM Dumper relies on the fact that the ROM is duplicated between 8 MB and
16 MB. This is not necessarily true (with EVT units) and is caused by
electronic properties of the ROM board. It therefore dumps the content of
the memory between 8 and 16 MB virtual.

ROM Dumper will dump the unpatched base ROM. You don't need to remove
the system patch to dump the ROM.

Please note that ROM Dumper isn't really a very good example of a TCP/IP
server or program. I really wrote it quickly, bypassing many good practices.
I just wanted it to work (and it seems to). You may need to restart your
Newton if something wrong occurs.

Usage
-----
Press ROM Dumper's start button. This will connect to the internet (if you
aren't connected yet) and it will listen on port 10080.
Then connect to port 10080 on a desktop computer and save the result to a
file. The easiest way to do it is to use the terminal with nc program utility.

Syntax is:

nc <newton's ip address> 10080 > <rom file>

For example, I was able to save my MP2x00 US ROM to a file called 717006 with:

nc 10.0.1.202 10080 > 717006

For your information, the MP2x00 US ROM's md5 sum is
70dc5f5f3102e44f15dc93f356b98add.

No graphical utility on the desktop side is provided because I'd better
spend my time on other tasks.

Compilation
-----------
To compiler ROMDumper native code, you need toolserver(1) and associated
scripts, as well as Newton C++ Tools. NCTBuildMain doesn't work here for
some reason I ignore, hence the presence of ROMDumper.exp.a.

The package was build with NTK.
