# Some statistics:
# - we have about 1155873 lines of "C" code
# - we have about 21000 symbols that may refer to functions and methods
# - 100 functions fit into a Einetsin C file
# - this leads to 21000/100 = 210 Einstein files
# - one function is on everage 300 lines long -> 6.3 mio. lines of code
#

# All SWIs end in 003AD750 to allow task switching
